1) Schema has a collection property that MUST correspond with the name of some real collection
2) Do not know yet - need to check React+Redux how to populate a collection - was created
manually also
MDN has a file for populate - rather complicated, 
otherwise - ? manually only? why local db creates automatically
3) MongoDB is operated through standard HTTP requests - need to take a course on it.
4) Installed postman - in other course used Axios - need to take one on axios also
5) Manipulated, queried collections, deleted, added, modified.
6) Need to rehearsal sometimes the Schema design
if Schema properties do not match mlab -so what?
